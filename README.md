Machine Learning Notebooks
==========================

This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in
python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O'Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do):

Simply open the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks you are interested in:

* Using [jupyter.org's notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb)
    * note: [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb) also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly,
* or by cloning this repository and running Jupyter locally. This option lets you play around with the code. In this case, follow the installation instructions below.

# Installation

First, you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/), if you don't have it already.

Next, clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing the following commands:
    $ git clone https://github.com/benech17/Named-Entity-Recognition.git
    $ cd Named-Entity-Recognition

If you are familiar with Python and you know how to install Python libraries, go ahead and install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` and jump to the [Starting Jupyter](#starting-jupyter) section. If you need detailed instructions, please read on.

## Python & Required Libraries
Of course, you obviously need Python. You should prefer the Python 3.6.X version.
On Linux, unless you know what you are doing, you should use your system's packaging system. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, type:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python3

jump to the [Using pip](#using-pip) section.


## Using pip 
you need to install several scientific Python libraries that are necessary for this project, in particular NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and TensorFlow (and a few others). For this, you can either use Python's integrated packaging system, pip, or you may prefer to use your system's own packaging system (if available, e.g. on Linux, or on MacOSX when using MacPorts or Homebrew). The advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated Python environments with different libraries and different library versions (e.g. one environment for each project). The advantage of using your system's packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your Python libraries and your system's other packages. Since I have many projects with different library requirements, I prefer to use pip with isolated environments. 

These are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries.
First you need to make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:

    $ pip3 install --user --upgrade pip

The `--user` option will install the latest version of pip only for the current user. If you prefer to install it system wide (i.e. for all users), you must have administrator rights (e.g. use `sudo pip3` instead of `pip3` on Linux), and you should remove the `--user` option. The same is true of the command below that uses the `--user` option.

Next, you can optionally create an isolated environment. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially very different libraries, and different versions:

    $ pip3 install --user --upgrade virtualenv
    $ virtualenv -p `which python3` env

This creates a new directory called `env` in the current directory, containing an isolated Python environment based on Python 3. If you installed multiple versions of Python 3 on your system, you can replace `` `which python3` `` with the path to the Python executable you prefer to use.

Now you must activate this environment. You will need to run this command every time you want to use this environment.

    $ source ./env/bin/activate

Next, use pip to install the required python packages. If you are not using virtualenv, you should add the `--user` option.

    $ pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Great! You're all set, you just need to start Jupyter now.

## Starting Jupyter
Okay! You can now start Jupyter, simply type:

    $ jupyter notebook

This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory. If your browser does not open automatically, visit [127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree). Click on `index.ipynb` to get started!

Congrats! You are ready to learn Machine Learning, hands on!
